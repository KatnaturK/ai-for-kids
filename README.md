1. Download the code from github
2. Run the index.html file on your browser (recommended browser - chrome)
3. No need to add any additional libraries or packages.
4. Start exploring!

Below are the steps on how to use the application :

1. The first page displayed gives the user an option to upload an image. After uploading the input image, click on _Predict Image_ button to see what objects the model detects. The user can also click on _model summary_ button to get additional details about the design of the network.

1. After clicking the Predict Image button, a lot of information is displayed on the screen. Along with showing the output of the model, we give a brief overview about convolution, activation functions and other details to understand how the network predicts.
